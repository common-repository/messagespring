Places a button/link on your site that will call an Omnichannel widget to capture subscribers in any language and topic via multiple app, SMS or email

== Description ==
MessageSpring simplifies communication by reaching every businesses’ essential audiences through a single platform, with the right message, at the right time, in the audience’s preferred language – in a growing number of channels.
 
This plugin connects your WordPress site to your MessageSpring account via an API Key that is unique to your account.
 
You can learn more about MessageSpring at our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/messagespring/).
 
You can also read below for an explanation of our features and benefits.

= Easily sign up to MessageSpring =
It takes only 3-4 minutes to create a complete account and profile on MessageSpring and start communicating with your audiences.

= Capture subscribers and their communication preferences easily =
With our subscriber widget that this plugin places on your WordPress site, your audience (subscribers) can opt in to your messages in their preferred channel and subscribe to your topics (which you define) in their language. As you'll read below, you don't even need to know what their language preference is but you can see it in their CRM record. You can see how this works by watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYgTUYTSOIs).

= Take advantage of MessageSpring's Omnichannel feature =
At MessageSpring, we appreciate that people have different preferences when it comes to where they want to receive their messages from the businesses in their lives.  Some people like SMS while others prefer email. 

Therefore, with MessageSpring, you can write your message once and we deliver it to your audience in their preferred channels.  Currently, those channels include our MessageSpring app, SMS, email, Facebook posts, Instagram posts, tweets on Twitter and even LinkedIn.

= Link your business social media accounts to your MessageSpring account =

= Cater to all languages with high quality translation =
It's already 2023 and businesses are still under delivering when it comes to messaging in other languages.  We've wired together many different translation capabilities so that you can deliver high quality messages in any language without any effort on your part. You don't need to care about what language someone wants. We store their language preferences in the CRM that comes free with your account.  Just write your message in your comfort language and send it to your audiences.  If your audience is 10,000 people and they need 150 different languages then we have you covered. They see it in their language but have access to the source language if needed.

= Text to Speech =
Streaming services are creating a generation of people who don't like to read.  They'd rather watch or listen. Why do you think Audible and text to speech services are popular?  Allow your audiences to listen to your messages in their language without any effort on your part.

= Digital Vouchers =
Deliver vouchers to your audience’s smart phones in their language. The MessageSpring app comes with a digital voucher wallet with redemption capability. Stop using single language paper vouchers and cater to everyone more efficiently. 

*This is a free feature available to all pricing plans.*

= Digital Membership Cards =
Get rid of plastic membership cards and deploy digital membership cards to your audience’s smartphones

*This is a free feature available to all pricing plans.*

= Proximity Messages via Beacons =
Sometimes, messages have better context in specific locations.  Using our proximity beacons, you can deliver messages to your audience members when they pass through your door, stand at your cashier register or sit at a specific table. Watch our [beacon video](https://youtu.be/uO2le5Ly5nI) for more information.

*This is a free feature available to all pricing plans. However, you would need to buy our beacons as they are sourced from our supplier [Estimote](https://www.estimote.com).*

= What makes MessageSpring unique =
MessageSpring enables businesses of any size to write a topic driven message once in any language and have it delivered to entire audiences or a group or an individual in the recipients’ channel of choice, language and and topic.  This way, people get what they want where they want in their native language.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a MessageSpring account before using the MessageSpring Plugin? =
 
Yes, this plugin is for businesses who already have a MessageSpring account. If you don't have one already, you can click the link provided and create one in minutes. 
 
= Is MessageSpring expensive? =
No. MessageSpring costs about the same as bulk SMS for businesses.  However, on top of SMS you get many other valuable features including:
* A built-in CRM
* International SMS delivery
* Subscriber onboarding tools
* Messages delivered in the languages requested by your audience members - no translation or effort on your part.
* A free website with your account (free of charge)
* Digital membership cards (free of charge)
* Team Members backed by sophisticated roles and permissions
* Proximity Beacons
* Conversations (similar to Facebook Messenger)
* Topic based message delivery
* And much more

= Do my subscribers need to install the MessageSpring app? =
No! Your subscribers can subscribe to your message stream via email or SMS. Once they do that, they can enjoy messages in their language, multimedia, text to speech all in the topics they've selected.  They can also react to your message such as like and report.

However, the experience for them will be superior if they install the MessageSpring app. With the MessageSpring app they can take advantage of the digital membership cards, vouchers, and proximity beacons.  The reason that the app is required is that the membership cards and vouchers are stored in a wallet in the app.  Also, for proximity beacons to work, our app is required to detect the bluetooth signal.
 
= Do you support SMS messages? =
We don’t have to do that.  We do it better.  Every message that you send is a private website. Any multimedia in your message is available on that website. This makes it less expensive.
 
= How do I translate messages? =
 You don’t.  We do.  We have integrated with 3 AI based translation engines to ensure that highest quality language. We detect the language that you’re authoring with and we deliver that message to everyone in your audience in their language. You need to do nothing.
 
= Why do I have to choose the channel(s) every time I send a message? =
This gives you the flexibility to deliver messages only to a particular channel.  For example, maybe you want to send an offer to your SMS segment to encourage them to install and use the MessageSpring app.
 
We make it simple.  You choose your recipient list and we figure out which channels are needed and you just select channels that should be used.
 
= How do I link my MessageSpring account to my WordPress website? =
1) Log in to your MessageSpring Dashboard
2) Navigate to the Subscriber Widget left hand menu item
3) In that page, you'll find an API Token.  Click on the "Copy Code" button to copy that API token
4) Navigate back to the MessageSpring Plugin settings page and aste the API token into the API token field.
5) Test your token.

**Integration with 3rd Parties**
As we describe above, this plugin allows you to add a button or link to your WordPress site that connects to your MessageSpring account via the MessageSpring Open API.  The connection is made with the API token that's available in your MessageSpring Dashboard.  Please keep this private.

The connections to this external MessageSpring system are limited.  One validates your API token. The Javascript behind the button or link collects subscriber information that they volunteer by opting in.  The popup also has links to the same terms and conditions below.
